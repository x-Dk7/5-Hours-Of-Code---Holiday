### 5 Hours Of Code Before The Holidays!

  For this project I decided to code a snake game that includes user interaction so players can move around and grab the apples. The player will start off as a single cube until the player runs into a green cube (apple) and consumes it, when the player consumes the apple, the tail of the snake will grow. If you run into yourself, you will lose all progress and you will have the choice to play again. At the end of your game, it will show you your score and it will tell you that you lost.
